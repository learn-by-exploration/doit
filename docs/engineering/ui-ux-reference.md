## What this doc will cover

When the research is done, this file will be a single cited
reference for the UI/UX principles in
[`../design/04-ui-ux-principles.md`](../design/04-ui-ux-principles.md):

- **Nielsen's 10 heuristics** with citations to the NN/g
  articles.
- **Don Norman's 7 design principles** with citations to
  *The Design of Everyday Things*.
- **Material 3 foundations** with citations to m3.material.io.
- **Apple Human Interface Guidelines** with citations to
  developer.apple.com/design.
- **WCAG 2.2 AA** with citations to w3.org/WAI and WebAIM.
- **Motion, i18n, RTL** with citations to the relevant
  W3C, Apple, and Android docs.

The doc is a *reference* — it backs the claims in
`04-ui-ux-principles.md` with primary sources. The principles
doc is the *operational* layer; this is the *citation* layer.

## How to author this doc

1. Use the `Agent` tool with `WebSearch` + `WebFetch` to
   scrape the URL list above in 4-5 parallel batches.
2. For each principle in
   [`../design/04-ui-ux-principles.md`](../design/04-ui-ux-principles.md),
   add a citation to the primary source.
3. Pull quoted excerpts (with citation) for the load-bearing
   claims: the 4.5:1 contrast ratio, the 48dp touch target,
   the 200ms "feels instant" threshold, the 3-state heuristic
   for skeleton vs spinner, etc.
4. Keep the doc readable — bullet points with links, not a
   wall of quoted text. The principles doc is the
   operational layer; this is the citation layer.
5. Commit as `docs(ux): add UI/UX reference with primary-source
   citations` when the research is done.
